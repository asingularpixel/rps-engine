		Made with ❤️ by Remy Bacigalupi.<br><br>

		Concept heavily inspired by "You Are Predictable" on the Google Play Store.<br>
		Strategies inspired by / taken from:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>"You Are Predictable" on the Google Play Store</li>
			<li>The "Iocaine Powder" RPS engine made by Dan Egnor, (referencing mostly from this article since I can't read C code: https://web.archive.org/web/20110723203327/http://www.ofb.net/~egnor/iocaine.html)<br>(Thank you very much for making this, without it I would've been lost on how to make this thing actually win games)</li><br>
		</ul>
		
		Thanks for playing!
