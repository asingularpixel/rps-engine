A Rock-Paper-Scissors engine that tries to beat a human.

Some fun tidbits:
- You can use [A, W, D] or [Left Arrow, Up Arrow, Right Arrow] as controls (Rock, Paper, and Scissors respectively)
- Something else, probably (that I forgot about including here)

TODO:
- A lot.
- Make the credits page just read from and render this instead to make this all a lot simpler.

Concept heavily inspired by "You Are Predictable" on the Google Play Store.

Strategies inspired by / taken from:
- "You Are Predictable" on the Google Play Store</li>
- The "Iocaine Powder" RPS engine made by Dan Egnor, (referencing mostly from this article since I can't read C code: https://web.archive.org/web/20110723203327/http://www.ofb.net/~egnor/iocaine.html)
  - (Thank you very much for making this, without it I would've been lost on how to make this thing actually win games)

This was made in a few days, so it's messy and doesn't work the best yet. Ideally, I want this to quickly figure out the opponent and start beating them or make the "game" structured to better favor how the cpu takes some time to start really figuring out the opponent.
