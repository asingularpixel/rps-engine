Code by Remy Bacigalupi.

Concept heavily inspired by "You Are Predictable" on the Google Play Store.
Strategies inspired by / taken from:
- "You Are Predictable" on the Google Play Store
- The "Iocaine Powder" RPS engine, mostly from this awesome article: https://web.archive.org/web/20110723203327/http://www.ofb.net/~egnor/iocaine.html
    - (Thank you very much for making this, without it I would've been lost on how to make this thing actually win games)
